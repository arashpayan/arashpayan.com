If you're trying to get T-Zones working on the iPhone 2.0 software, you don't need to follow the [old manual way](../1) of doing it. Just go into Cydia and search for `TZones Hack` and install the BigBoss tweak that comes up. Restart your phone, and you're good to go.

As usual, the YouTube app still won't work with this hack.
