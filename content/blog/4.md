I recently received an email from [Ryan McFall](http://www.hope.edu/cs/mcfall/) that he is using FileTree, and he noticed that the FileTree doesn't actually display everything accurately on Windows. The shortcoming was in the fact that Windows explorer displays all directories first before displaying files in a tree. He fixed the problem, and kindly sent the changes back to me for posting on ~~the website~~ [GitHub](https://github.com/arashpayan/FileTree).

I hope this makes FileTree useful for many more people.
