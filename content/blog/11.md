After restoring a family member's iPhone that was acting up, I began setting up t-zones for them, but couldn't find the t-zones hack in the BigBoss repository. After some experimenting, I soon realized that none of the proxy configuration work is required anymore either. Setting up t-zones on your iPhone is now an easy 3 step process:

1. Go to `Settings`->`General`->`Network`->`Cellular Data Network`
2. Type `wap.voicestream.com` for the APN (leave the `username` and `password`) blank
3. There's no step 3!

That's all there is to it. YouTube even works over t-zones now.

BTW, if you're a long time T-Mobile customer, you can call in right now and ask about the loyal customer plan. If you've been with them long enough, you can have a plan which gives you unlimited minutes for only $50 a month.
