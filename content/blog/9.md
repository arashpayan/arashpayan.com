The project that I've been working on for the past couple months has finally come to fruition, and is available for purchase on the iTunes App Store.

[Jabeh](http://jabeh.org/) is a puzzle game where you search for 12 hidden stones on a board. Arrows on the board point in the direction of one or more stones, and the column and row numbers show how many stones are in the respective column and row. Using deduction you can figure out where the stones can't be in order to ultimately find out where all 12 stones are. While you're playing the game, some light music plays in the background (which you can download for free from the [Jabeh website](http://jabeh.org/)), and when you solve the puzzle you're rewarded with one of the beautiful pieces of art created exclusively for Jabeh.

You can get [Jabeh](http://itunes.com/app/Jabeh) now for $4.99 or download [Jabeh Lite](http://itunes.com/app/JabehLite) for free if you wanna try before you buy.
