My first iPhone app has just been posted to the iTunes app store. It's called [Prayer Book](http://arashpayan.com/projects/PrayerBook/) and it contains 231 English prayers from the Writings of the [Bahá'í Faith](http://www.bahai.org/). They're organized by categories and you can bookmark your favorite prayers for easy access as well. I'll be updating the program over time with new features and prayer translations, and eventually I'd like to have all the Writings of the Bahá'í Faith in there.

It's available for free on the iTunes store, so go ahead and [take it for a spin](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=292151014&mt=8).
