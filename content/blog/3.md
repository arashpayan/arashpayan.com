I finally upgraded my iPhone from 1.1.1 to 1.1.4, and after dealing with the Installer.app `main script execution failed` error ([solution here](http://www.modiphone.net/installer-main-script-execution-failed-fix/)), I began to setup my EDGE access. The steps are mostly the same [as before](../1), with the exception of the location of the preferences.plist file. Previously, it was located in the user partition, but now the file is located in:

```
/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
```

In addition to the upgrade, I also took the opportunity to install [Telesphoreo/Cydia](http://www.saurik.com/id/1), which is a port of APT to the iPhone by Jay Freeman. There seems to be lots of interesting ports available to install, and a Java VM, which is of particular interest to me. If I make any progress in developing with the new tools, I'll post any helpful info I find.
